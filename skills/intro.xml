			Welcome to the APDE learning environment!
		</text>
		<text>
			This tutorial system is designed to be example-based, encouraging you to learn by 
			tinkering with existing code. However, a series of skill tutorials are available 
			to guide you and teach you necessary concepts.
		</text>
		<text>
			The skill tutorials are arranged in a tree. In order to complete a tutorial, you must 
			complete each of its prerequisites, represented by arrows. You will find that there 
			are many different ways to progress through the tutorials, so work at your own pace 
			and learn about the topics that interest you!

			Throughout the tutorials, you will encounter code snippets such as the one below. 
			Some of these snippets are runnable, which will allow you to use the Sandbox to 
			quickly see what the code does.

			Try pressing the run button:

		<code runnable="true">
			float radius = 100;
			boolean pmousePressed = false;
			
			void setup() {
			  fullScreen();
			  colorMode(HSB, 360, 100, 100);
			  strokeWeight(5);
			  noFill();
			}
			
			void draw() {
			  background(0);
			  stroke((frameCount / 4) % 360, 80, 80);
			  ellipse(width / 2, height / 2, radius * 2, radius * 2);
			  
			  if (mousePressed &amp;&amp; sq(mouseX - width / 2) + sq(mouseY - height / 2) > sq(radius)) {
			    float theta = atan2(mouseY - height / 2, mouseX - width / 2);
			    line(width / 2 + cos(theta) * radius, height / 2 + sin(theta) * radius, mouseX, mouseY);
			    
			    if (pmousePressed) {
			      float mag = sqrt(sq(mouseX - pmouseX) + sq(mouseY - pmouseY)) / 10;
			      radius += mag;
			    }
			    
			    pmousePressed = true;
			  } else {
			    radius -= min((radius - 100) * 0.05, 20);
			    pmousePressed = false;
			  }
			}

			You aren't expected to understand how this code works quite yet, as it uses some 
			fairly advanced concepts. However, by the end of the tutorials, you will be able 
			to create similar sketches.
